                <p>Beautiful Kosrae (pronounced Kosh-rye) is one of the island States of the Federated States of Micronesia, just a delightful boat ride north of the Equator. The second largest island, Kosrae is a paradise for divers and adventurers alike, with the most beautiful white beaches in Micronesia.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Kosrae, called “The Sleeping Lady” because of the shape of one of its picturesque mountains is covered with dense tropical jungles and high volcanic peaks, with lush river valleys and spectacular views. The island is surrounded by very healthy fringing reefs teeming with splendidly colorful tropical fish feeding off the spectacular corals. Visibility often exceeds 30 meters (100') — perfect for spotting paddling sea turtles and large rays winging their way through the blue waters. The coral reefs, which slope steeply into the clear blue depths, are one of the great attractions of Kosrae. Equally attractive are its warm-hearted people. Visitors leave here with vivid memories and a yearning to return.</p>

The discount fare covers up to five stops in a 30-day period for travel to Palau, Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and others - the first stop must be scheduled when the ticket is purchased, but the rest can be left open. A round-trip Visit Micronesia fare from Honolulu with stops in Majuro, Kosrae and Pohnpei totals approximately $1,100.

Tell them the net fare tour code is VMICR to help them find the discounts. Be persistent, this fare is new and not know well with United reservation staff.</p>

                <p>You should plan on dressing in a casual but conservative manner, both for protection from the sun and so as not to offend the local people. Light summer clothing is always appropriate. Throughout the Pacific it is considered immodest to reveal the upper leg. Men and women should wear long shorts (Bermuda length), skirts or lava lava's while in the villages or in public areas such as restaurants. Dress is more relaxed at our resort. When attending Sunday church services, men should wear long pants and a shirt with a collar. Women should keep in mind that modesty of attire is preferable. A skirt or dress would be more appropriate than slacks, and a top with at least a short sleeve.</p>
